# SongParodyApp
A prototype/MVP of a song parody maker app for iOS.

This app allows users to search for a popular song, rewrite its lyrics, and record themselves singing their original parody of the song, all in all, making a short music video in as little as 15 minutes.

Made using Swift, Xcode storyboards, and MVC design. Hobby project in summer of 2022.

To test, download code. Then, run ```pod install``` in the terminal at the root directory of this project. Then, run project in Xcode. Note that only two songs are currently loaded in the database: "Save Your Tears" by The Weeknd, and "A Whole New World" by ZAYN and Zhavia Ward. "A Whole New World" has all of its lyrics loaded, and "Save Your Tears" only has the first verse's lyrics loaded. Connect a physical device (up to iPhone 13 MAX) to be able to test camera and microphone capabilities while recording the music video.
