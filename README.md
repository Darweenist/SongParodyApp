# SongParodyApp
A prototype/MVP of a song parody maker app for iOS.

Made using Swift, Xcode storyboards, and MVC design. Hobby project in summer of 2022.

To test, download code. Then, run ```pod install``` in the terminal at the root directory of this project. Then, run project in Xcode. Use a physical device (up to iPhone 13 MAX) to test camera and microphone capabilities.
